    <p>Yesterdays technology -- today!</p>

    <p>Are you working on a sofware project? This may benefit you.
    `Makefiles` are an interface that helps 
    https://medium.com/@trevorgrayson/the-build-lifecycle-interface-every-software-project-needs-264e6affaac0
    
    </p>
    <p>This is about leveraging `Makefile`s</p>
    <h2>Including makef.io</h2>
    <p>For the initiated, who already use Makefiles, you can include
      makef.ios very simply by including the top of your Makefile.
    </p>

    <code>
      $(shell test -f Makef.io || curl -o Makef.io makef.io/python)
      include Makef.io
    </code>

    <p>
      `test -f Makef.io` will check to see if a `Makef.io` exists, the `curl` will
      download the file if it does not. Notice the `/python`.  This will download
      a stock Makefile for python.  It includes `test`, `clean`, `compile` targets.
      You may mix multiple Makef.ios together by continuing the slashes.
      <code>makef.io/python/travisci</code> will include python targets and a target to
      build a `.travis.yml` build script for the project.
